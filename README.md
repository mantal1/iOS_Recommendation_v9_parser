# Recommendation_v9

## Overview
This script parses and analyzes application usage data from SQLite databases. It processes data from the `ZAMDAPPEVENT` table in `recommendation_v9.sqlite` and maps AdamIDs to application names using the `AdamID2app.txt` file. The output is saved as a CSV file, providing detailed information about application usage events.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `openpyxl`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mantal1/iOS_Recommendation_v9_parser
   ```
   Or download the repository as a zip file and extract it to a local directory.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd iOS_Recommendation_v9_parser
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Script
1. Ensure you have `recommendation_v9.sqlite` and `AdamID2app.txt` available.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `Recommendation_v9.py` is located.
4. Run the script with the correct paths:
   ```sh
   python Recommendation_v9.py path/to/recommendation_v9.sqlite path/to/AdamID2app.txt
   ```
   Example:
   ```sh
   python Recommendation_v9.py D:\Cases\Case1234\recommendation_v9.sqlite D:\Cases\Case1234\AdamID2app.txt
   ```
5. Enter the case number when prompted:
   ```
   Please enter the case number: Case1234
   ```
6. The script processes the data and generates an output file:
   ```
   Data has been written to D:\Cases\Case1234\Case1234-recommendation_v9-StoreUser.db-parsed.csv
   ```
